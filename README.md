# Semi-Supervised-Learning-with-GAN
Semi-supervised refers to the training process where the model gets trained only with a few labeled images but the dataset contains a lot of unlabled images. In regular GAN, the descriminator is trained in unsupervised way in which it predicts whether the image is real or fake. But in semi-supervised gan, the discriminator gets trained in a supervised manner on class labels of real images or multiclass classification. 
The unsupervised discriminator learns features of the images. On the other hand, the supervised discriminator predicts the class labels. Usually, in standard Gan, we train the generator to generate fake images. In semi-supervised Gan, we also train a generator to generate fake images from latent space but we mostly focus on the supervised discriminator. By using Semi-supervied gan, we can achieve more accuracy in image classification than simply using CNN.
